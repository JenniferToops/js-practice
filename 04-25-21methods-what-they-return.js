/* ShlVsv: Definition and Usage The pop() method removes the last element of an array, and returns that element.
ShlVsv: It returns an element not an array so you can't call shift on that
ShlVsv: when you stack it's like calling a method on the return value
ShlVsv: When you call split() it return an array so you can use array method on that array again
ShlVsv: Definition and Usage The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.
ShlVsv: See this is the definition of spilt()
ShlVsv: It returns an array
ShlVsv: so you can call pop() on that
ShlVsv: like split(" ").pop()
ShlVsv: but you can't do pop().split(" ")
